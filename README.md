#### Metaheuristics for the generalized assignment problem written in Javascript.

Implemented metaheuristics are:
- Simulated annealing
- Tabu search
- Iterated local search
- Variable neighborhood search

The latter two algorithms are the ones giving the best performance, about 3% above the optimum on large instances.

Costs of optimal solutions can be found at http://astarte.csr.unibo.it/gapdata/gapinstances.html for most instances.

The original instace files can be found at http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/gapinfo.html and http://www.al.cm.is.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~yagiura/gap/.
